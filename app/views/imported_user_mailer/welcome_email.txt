Hello Gay City Library Patrons!

This is a one time email to let you know some important information regarding your Gay City Library Patron account with us.  As of today we have switched over to a new catalog system built especially for us by one of our super star volunteers.  The new system will allow you to search our collection, view your account info, and see your loan history/current loans/overdue books by logging in from any internet browser, anywhere in the world!

LibCat - the Library Catalog for the Michael C. Weidemann LGBT Library Collection at Gay City: http://libcat.gaycity.org/

We have set up an account for you already in the new system using your existing account data.  All you need to do is log in using your email address and the generic password of "gaycitylibrary". Then change your password to something easy for you to remember (http://libcat.gaycity.org/users/edit).

If you have a few free moments, we would also love for you to complete a short survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/184splLkAyeY3GXkUYsxm6WiZznOcKdCNpvJjvlHv79I/viewform?c=0&w=1) about yourself and your experience at the Gay City Library.  This is obviously completely optional and totally anonymous, but the data collected will be incredibly helpful for us.  Not only will it help us better serve your needs, but it will help us when applying for grants that could provide much needed funding for our Library.

For those of you who may not know, you can also browse our collection on LibraryThing (http://www.librarything.com/catalog/GayCityLGBTLibrary) or GoodReads (https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4689433-gay-city-lgbt-library) if you want to see more information about our books, including book reviews from our Volunteer Librarians and Patrons like you!

Thank you for being involved with the Gay City Library!  Feel fee to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
